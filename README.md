# Tycho2 Version 0.2

A mini-app for neutral-particle, discrete-ordinates (SN), transport on parallel-decomposed meshes of tetrahedra.

## Background and History

Tycho2 was originally written by Kris Garrett while a postdoc at Los Alamos National Laboratory (see the license) in the
CCS-2 group, working together with Jim Warsa and Jae Chang, members of the Capsaicin deterministic SN transport code project 
at LANL. The goal of the mini-app is to provide a simple platform to explore the strange new world of GPUs and heterogeneous
computer architectures. The idea being that, like the SNAP, UMT, and Kripke mini-apps for structured meshes*, potential approaches 
and implementations for unstructured mesh transport could be investigated and perhaps transferred to the more complicated Capsaicin
project if they showed promise. Makes sense, right? Anyway, Kris has left LANL and now it's up to Jim Warsa and any other contributors
to take up where he left off. Recent work by Dan Ibanez of Sandia National Laboratory, with Kris, on using Kokkos in Tycho2 is
gratefully acknowledged.

Tycho2 is based on a code called Tycho, written by Shawn Pautz (Sandia National Laboratory) sometime around the year 2000,
when he was at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Alhough Tycho wasn't a mini-app (that term hadn't been invented yet), 
Shawn was using Tycho to explore ideas for parallel, unstructrued mesh, SN sweeps. Remember, those were early days. 
Although we didn't borrow any code base from the original implementation, we named our mini-app Tycho2 in an homage to 
Shawn's original code (and because Tycho2 works only on tets, like Tycho).

*Note that, to the best of our knowledge, while UMT is targeted to unstructred meshes, the meshes are actually logially 
orthgonal, without the additional complications and computational overhead associated with SN sweeps on meshes with 
arbitrary orientations and connectivtiies.

This is still being heavily developed, so ...
